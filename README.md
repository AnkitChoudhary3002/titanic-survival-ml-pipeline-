# Titanic Survival Prediction – End-to-End ML Pipeline

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline built using Python and scikit-learn. The focus of this project is on designing a clean, modular, and reusable pipeline rather than optimizing model accuracy.

## Project Overview
- Dataset: Titanic Survival Dataset (Kaggle)
- Objective: Predict passenger survival using a structured ML pipeline
- Key focus: Data preprocessing + model training combined into a single pipeline

## Key Features
- End-to-end pipeline using scikit-learn
- Handles missing values and categorical variables
- Clean separation of data preprocessing and model logic
- Trained pipeline saved and reused for prediction
- Reproducible workflow suitable for production-style ML projects

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
